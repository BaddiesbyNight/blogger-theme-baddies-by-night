# 🩸 Baddies By Night – Blogger Theme

A dark, custom Blogger theme built for the **Baddies By Night** project.

> **Defense Against the Dark Arts for the Modern Mind**  
> We explore the uncomfortable, the unseemly, the questionable, and the unsettling—not to glorify the dark, but to illuminate the path of innovation. By engaging the taboo, we aim to accelerate the velocity of ideas and thought.
